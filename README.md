# text_to_image

By using stable diffusion we have made a pre-trained text to image generation model and also have code in codespace. 

The proposed project will follow a systematic methodology to design, develop, and
evaluate an AI-based text-to-image generation system. The steps include:
• Data Collection:
 Large-scale text–image datasets such as COCO (Common Objects in Context),
Conceptual Captions, and LAION-5B will be utilized. These datasets provide
millions of paired text–image samples, enabling the model to learn semantic
relationships between textual descriptions and their corresponding visuals.
• Preprocessing:
a. Text Processing: Text descriptions will be cleaned, tokenized, and
converted into embeddings using transformer-based language models
(e.g., CLIP or BERT).
b. Image Processing: Images will be normalized, resized, and augmented
to ensure consistency and robustness during training.
• Model Selection:
 Multiple architectures will be explored:

 a. Diffusion Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for generating high-resolution,
realistic images.
b. GAN-based Architectures (e.g., AttnGAN) to enhance text–image
alignment.
c. Transformer-based Models for improved semantic understanding of
complex prompts.
• Training / Fine-Tuning:
a. Models will be trained on paired text–image datasets.
b. Fine-tuning will be carried out to improve semantic alignment and reduce
inconsistencies in generated outputs.
c. Transfer learning will be applied where applicable to optimize training
efficiency.
• Evaluation:
 The system will be evaluated using both quantitative metrics and
qualitative analysis.
a. Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): To measure realism of generated
images.
b. CLIP Similarity Score: To evaluate semantic alignment between text and
image.
c. User Feedback: To assess usability, creativity, and overall quality of
results.
• Deployment:
 An interactive prototype application will be developed using Streamlit or Flask,
allowing users to input textual prompts and view generated images in real time.
This deployment will demonstrate practical usability and highlight real-world
applications of the system in areas such as education, entertainment, and design.
